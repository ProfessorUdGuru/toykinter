# toykinter
Custom Tkinter widgets made by inheriting from other Tkinter widgets.

The ttk widgets are harder to configure than the original Tkinter widgets which are easy to configure by class. The purpose of the Toykinter project is to provide easily configurable widgets such as tabbed pages, combobox, optionally auto-hiding scrollbar, title bar, window border/sizer, autofill entries, sizegrip, tooltips, and more. Modules for instantly reconfiguring every widget in the application will also be provided.

This repo is a demo app comprising one or more working models of each Toykinter widget that's currenlty functioning and code for other widgets that needs to be finished, fixed, or refactored. A do list is at the bottom of the Docs tab. To suggest improvement, do list items, etc., send me a message. I'm busy with other things but I will be making additions to the do list.

The code has been around a while but this demo app is brand new. It will take some time to get everything working just right.
