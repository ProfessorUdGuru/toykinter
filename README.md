# toykinter
Custom Tkinter widgets made by inheriting from other Tkinter widgets.

The ttk widgets are harder to configure than the original Tkinter widgets which are easy to configure by class. The purpose of the Toykinter project is to provide easily configurable widgets such as combobox, optionally auto-hiding scrollbar, title bar, window border/sizer, two varieties of autofill entries, and dropdown menu. A module for instantly reconfiguring every widget in the application will also be provided.

The code for all of these widgets has been started and most of the widgets are already finished or usable. It will take me some time to get the code sorted out from the app it's embedded in, and pushed to this repo.
